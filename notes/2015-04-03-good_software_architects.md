I came across the best quote. It was in the HN [comments][link] from
the software architecture paper posting. Here it is:

> That's a horrible description. The best people with "software
> architect" in their title that I have worked with have focused on
> total system quality through striving towards simplicity mainly by
> focusing on development and tooling and using their position as the
> arbiter of technical decisions to guide the system under development
> to coherent whole that fullfills the business requirements in a
> technically sound way.

I think the quote describes exactly how I try to do my job. Focus on
the complete solution and strive for a technically correct & coherent
way. Naturally the quote is also paired with examples of bad
architects. That will never be me.
