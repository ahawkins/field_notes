Entertaining [episode][link] of the Ship show podcast. Not many
takeways though since I'm not actively working in this area. However
something did stick with me. They started to talk about the upgrade
path for installed packages. The comments were "who in the fuck
upgrades packages?" Note, that they do not usually swear on the show
so it was obvious they were all emotionally engaged in this topic. And
it's true. I've noticed that changed in my own work over the years.
Who in the fuck upgrades packages these days? Isn't everyone using a
VM or have some sort of configuration management? Why in their right
mind are people running `sudo apt-get -y upgrade` on production
systems, more over why is there shell access on these boxes? Nice way
to pass an hour.
